# Epitech - Gomoku
## Module: B5 - Application Development

### Description
The goal of this project is to implement a Gomoku Narabe game bot (also called Wuzi Qi, Slope, Darpion or  
Five in a Row), focusing on the performance of its artificial intelligence.

#### GAME RULES
This is a 2-player game that is played on a 20x20 game board (called goban). We use a very simplified  
version of the game. Every player plays a stone at his/her turn, and the game ends as soon as one has a 5  
stones in a row (vertically, horizontally or diagonaly) - and thus wins.
